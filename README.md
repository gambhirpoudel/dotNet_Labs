# Lab 2: Create Classes, Objects, and Implement Object-Oriented Features

**Due Date: 15 January 2024, 23:59**

## Instructions

### Task 1: Student Class Implementation
Create a class `Student` with basic fields, properties, and methods. Include constructors (both types) and a destructor(finalizer) in your implementation. Demonstrate the use of these constructors and the finalizer.

### Task 2: Advanced Class Features
Demonstrate the use of `this`, static constructor, and object initializers in your class. Provide a clear program showcasing these features.

### Task 3: Indexer Implementation
Write a program to show the implementation of an indexer in a class. Use an example to demonstrate the functionality of the indexer.

### Task 4: Dynamic Binding (Polymorphism)
Show dynamic binding through a clear program. Implement polymorphism to showcase how it allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.

### Task 5: Virtual Method Implementation
Write a program to demonstrate the use of a virtual method. Implement a base class with a virtual method and then override it in a derived class.

### Task 6: Abstract Method and 'base' Keyword
Create an abstract method and show its implementation in a derived class. Additionally, demonstrate the use of the `base` keyword in the context of inheritance.

### Task 7: Overloading of Methods and Operators
Write a program that shows the overloading of both methods and operators (binary and unary). Provide examples to illustrate each case.

### Task 8: Interface Implementation
Create an interface, implement it in a class, and demonstrate its usage. Show how a class can implement multiple interfaces.

### Task 9: Enum Usage
Demonstrate the use of Enum in your program. Create an Enum and showcase its implementation in a practical scenario.

### Task 10: Generic Class and Methods
Create a generic class and methods. Show the implementation of the generic class and methods with examples.

### Task 11: Struct Implementation
Create a fully-featured structure (struct) and show its implementation. Demonstrate how to use a struct with examples.
