# Lab 3: Implementation of Inheritance

**Due Date: 19 January 2024, 23:59**

## Instructions

### Task 1: Single Inheritance
Write a program to show single inheritance. Create a base class and a derived class. Demonstrate how the derived class inherits from the base class.

### Task 2: Multilevel Inheritance
Write a program to show multilevel inheritance. Create a base class, a derived class from the base, and another class derived from the second class. Demonstrate the inheritance hierarchy.

### Task 3: Hierarchical Inheritance
Write a program to show hierarchical inheritance. Create a base class and two classes derived from the base. Illustrate how multiple classes can inherit from a single base class.

### Task 4: Multiple Inheritance (Feature Implementation)
Write a program to implement the features of multiple inheritance. Create interfaces or abstract classes and a class that inherits from multiple sources. Demonstrate how the class inherits features from multiple entities.

### Task 5: Sealing Function and Class
Write a program to demonstrate the sealing function and class. Implement a class or method and use the `sealed` keyword to prevent further inheritance or overriding.
