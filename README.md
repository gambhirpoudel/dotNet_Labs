# Lab 1: Basic Language Features

## Instructions

### Task 1: Temperature Conversion
Write a program in C# to convert centigrade to Fahrenheit using the formula: 
\[ F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot C + 32 \]
Do not change the expression. Provide appropriate input and display the result.

### Task 2: Grade Calculation
Write a program to read the mark of a subject and print the equivalent grade. Design your grading system and implement it in the program.

### Task 3: Perfect Number Identification
Write a program in C# to identify whether a given number is a perfect number or not. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

### Task 4: GCD Calculation
Write a program to evaluate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two given integers. Implement a function that returns the GCD.

### Task 5: Recursive Sum Calculation
Write a recursive program in C# to find the sum of \( n \) natural numbers. Use a recursive function for the summation.

### Task 6: Array Average Calculation
Write a C# program to store \( N \) numbers in a one-dimensional array and calculate its average with the help of a method.

### Task 7: Matrix Addition
Write a C# program for matrix addition using the function `add(int [,] a, int [,] b)`.

### Task 8: Bubble Sort
Write a program to arrange numbers in an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
